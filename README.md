# KirtanContract DApp

This project is a decentralized application (DApp) that interacts with the KirtanContract smart contract. The DApp allows users to view the contract owner's name and balance, and also transfer ether to the contract owner.

## Description

The KirtanContract DApp is built using Hardhat and React. It features a smart contract written in Solidity and a React frontend that provides an intuitive interface for interacting with the contract. The smart contract manages the functionality for retrieving the owner's name and balance, as well as transferring ether to the owner. The React frontend displays the owner's details and includes a form to initiate transfers.
